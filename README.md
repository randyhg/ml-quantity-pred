## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the quantity of items purchased based on historical data. This can help businesses in inventory management, demand forecasting, and optimizing the supply chain.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project should contain historical purchase data, including features such as:

- Date of purchase
- Day of purchase
- Product Name
- Product Code
- Quantity purchased
- Price

You can use your dataset or use our sample dataset `data.csv` on the root folder.

## Installation

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
